1. you know the dealo - in shell/terminal in the root of the project run the following command if you haven't already
# Create the virtual environment
2. python -m venv myenv
3. Windows: "myenv\Scripts\activate" If On macOS and Linux "source myenv/bin/activate"
4. pip install -r requirements.txt

FINALLY:
 
5. python main.py

Output to root:
"./Recordings/output.wav" (you can change the variable name to be more dynamic maybe use of time to make new files without overwrite)
